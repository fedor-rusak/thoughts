        "content": "Just for fun to be honest. Is not it fun to write small notes via terminal? Like you are real hacker but without vi or emacs! I enjoy working in terminal to some degree, it usually feels super productive to write short commands and get cool results. Like piping and shell scripting. And I wanted to capture that feel of productiveness in a tool for short notes. That is how I remember it at least.",
