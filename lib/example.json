        "content": "Just for fun to be honest. Is not it fun to write small notes via terminal? Like you are real hacker but without vi or emacs! I enjoy working in terminal to some degree, it usually feels super productive to write short commands and get cool results. Like piping and shell scripting. And I wanted to capture that feel of productiveness in a tool for short notes. That is how I remember it at least.",

Because no one is going to give real attention to ideas that only you care about. Great things in life require serious effort.

And current software terminals copy some of real terminal bahevior. Hence vt100 sequences in this project.",
